                     GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 3, 29 June 2007

 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                      Preamble

  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works.  The licenses for most software
are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it.  By
contrast, our license is intended to guarantee your freedom to share
the software and to change it.  Accordingly, it ensures that you
can legally copy the software, that you can redistribute it, and
that you can modify it.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if
you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
rights that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive
or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so
that everyone else also receives the same freedoms that you did.

  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making
the program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that
any patent must be licensed for everyoneâ€™s free use or not licensed
at all.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

                     TERMS AND CONDITIONS

  0. Definitions.

  "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

  "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other
kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks.

  "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under
this License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".

  "To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of
it in a way requiring copyright permission, other than the making
of an exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version"
of the earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.

  A "contributor" is someone who contributes to the development of
the Program.

  "You" means the licensee of this License, or any other person or
entity exercising rights under this License.  "Your" has a
corresponding meaning.

  "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work
for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source
form of a work.

  "The System Libraries" are the sublibraries and system utilities
that are used together with the work, but are not part of it.
(For example, in the case of an executable work, "System Libraries"
are those libraries that are included in the normal user environment
and are considered standard for the target platform.)

  "The Modified Version" refers to any derivative work based on
the Program.

  1. Source Code.

  The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work
for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source
form of a work.

  You must make the source code available to all recipients of the
Program, and must also include a copy of this License with it.  If you
distribute the Program in object code form, you must include a copy of
the source code, or make it available at no more than the cost of
distribution.

  2. Basic Permissions.

  You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice; keep intact all the notices that refer to this
License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other
recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the
Program.

  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for
a fee.

  3. Copyleft.

  You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise
to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program is void, and
will automatically terminate your rights under this License.

  However, if you are a member of a collective or an organization
that collects or manages rights for others, you may grant members
of that organization the same rights you have, but only to the
extent that your rights under this License have not been revoked.

  4. Modifications.

  You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    b) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.

    c) You must cause the source code for your modifications to be
    available to all recipients of the work.

  5. Distribution of Modified Source Versions.

  You may distribute a modified version of the Program under the
terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these
conditions:

    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    b) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.

    c) You must cause the source code for your modifications to be
    available to all recipients of the work.

  6. Distribution of Object Code Versions.

  You may distribute the object code version of the Program under
the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these
conditions:

    a) You must cause the object code to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    b) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.

    c) You must cause the source code for your modifications to be
    available to all recipients of the work.

  7. Conveying Modified Versions.

  You may convey a modified version of the Program under the terms
of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these
conditions:

    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    b) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.

    c) You must cause the source code for your modifications to be
    available to all recipients of the work.

  8. Termination.

  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of
the rights granted or affirmed under this License.  You may not
seek to enforce any additional restrictions.

  9. Acceptance.

  By copying, distributing or modifying the Program (or any work based
on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License and all
its terms and conditions.

  10. Use with Other Licenses.

  The GNU General Public License may be combined with other free
licenses.  However, all obligations from all licenses must be followed
simultaneously.

  11. No Warranty.

  The Program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but
WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
GNU General Public License for more details.

  12. Limitation of Liability.

  In no event shall the authors or copyright holders be liable to you
for any damages resulting from the use or inability to use the Program,
including but not limited to damages for loss of profits or other
commercial damages, even if they have been advised of the possibility
of such damages.

  13. Interpretation of Sections.

  If any section of this License is held to be unenforceable, such
holding shall not affect the validity of the remaining portions of
this License.

  14. Conclusion.

  This License is designed to ensure that the Program remains free
for all its users.  By following the guidelines in this License, you
will help ensure that software is free and open for everyone to use,
modify, and distribute.
